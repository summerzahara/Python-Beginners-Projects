# Hangman Hangman is one of the best Python projects for beginners who want a bit of a challenge. The game is about guessing a random word with a limited number of guesses. Although Hangman may sound rather simple, you need to consider a few key points, such as:
    # 1) You need to set a maximum limit for guesses.
    # 2) The player needs to be notified about the remaining number of guesses.
    # 3) Your player needs to be able to input their guesses.
    # 4) To get started, you need a way to generate random words to be guessed. The best way is to simply create a separate text file where you store the words or short phrases.

# This Python project will probably take you a bit longer, but itâ€™s great practice. You will have to think about random choice, variables, boolean values, inputs and outputs, strings, length, and much more.
